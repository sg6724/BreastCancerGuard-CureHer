## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & ML Model Training**

* Utilizes clean, structured datasets with critical features like age, tumor size, lymph nodes, etc.
* Models are trained using **scikit-learn**, optimized for accuracy and reliability.
* Models are serialized using **Joblib** for efficient FastAPI integration.

### 2️⃣ **User Symptom Input**

* The frontend (built in **React.js + Tailwind CSS**) allows users to input medical and lifestyle information anonymously.

### 3️⃣ **Risk Prediction**

* The backend (**FastAPI**) receives user input and passes it to the ML model.
* Returns a **Positive** or **Negative** diagnosis based on trained classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

### 4️⃣ **Personalized Recommendations**

* Based on the outcome:

  * If **Negative** → Provides health tips, screening reminders, and lifestyle advice.
  * If **Positive** → Offers action steps, awareness materials, and suggests hospital consultation.
